# Sider Enterprise Configuration

We provide the following tools to help Sider Enterprise setup.

1. Generator for Sider Enterprise configuration.
2. Generator for Sider Enterprise configuration using Docker Compose (this helps starting Sider Enterprise with minimal effort).
3. A docker image to run configuration generator.

## Requirements

1. You need Docker to build the configuration generator
2. You need Docker compose to use the Quickstart configuration

## Quickstart

### Generate the configuration

Build the Docker image and generate a configuration.

```
$ bin/build
$ bin/quickstart http://localhost:3000
```

You will find the `quickstart` directory and four `.env` files in the directory.

### Register applications to GitHub Enterprise

Sider requires two applications integrated with GitHub Enterprise.
Visit your GitHub Enterprise and register OAuth App and GitHub App.

The generator prints the URLs required to the registration.

### Configure for your environment

Edit the four `.env` files for your environment.
Required configurations are marked as `[REQUIRED]`.

### Setup Database

Start MySQL and run the database setup commands.

```
$ docker-compose up -d mysql
$ docker-compose run sideci_web bundle exec rake db:setup db:seed_fu
$ docker-compose run catpost_web bundle exec rake db:setup
$ docker-compose run setaria_web bundle exec rake db:setup
$ docker-compose kill
```

### Start Sider Enterprise

```
$ docker-compose up
```

And everything will work. ðŸŽ‰

### Webhook Note

If your GitHub Enterprise can access to your Sider Enterprise, everything will go fine.
However, if not, webhook cannot be sent to Sider Enterprise.
When you specify something like `http://localhost:3000`, your GitHub Enterprise cannot send webhooks.

Instead of receiving webhook to start event handler, you can simulate receiving webhooks with the following command.
This is usually required at the following points:

* When you are adding new organization
* When you open new pull request

When you try to add a new organization, you will be waiting on Sider after GitHub app installation step.
Run the following command to continue, and go to Sider dashboard.
Then you will see the organization you have installed Sider on.

```
# Simulate GitHub app installation
$ docker-compose run sideci_worker bundle exec rake github_app:sync
```

When you open new pull request or push a new commit to existing pull request, Sider automatically detects it and start analysis.
Run the following command to start analysis.

```
# Detect new commit on a pull request and run analysis
# Assume the repository is acme/server, and the number of the pull request is 123
$ docker-compose run sideci_worker bundle exec rake 'pull_request:sync[acme/server,123]'
```

## Configuration Generator

You can scaffold the config files, four `.env` files, for Sider Enterprise.

```
$ bin/build
$ bin/generate .
```

Edit the generated files.
Required configurations are marked as `[REQUIRED]`.
